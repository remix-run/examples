## Example

To run it, you need to either:

### 1. Run against a Firebase Project

1. [Create a Firebase Project](https://console.firebase.google.com)
2. Enable Auth (with email) and Firestore
3. Add a Web App
4. Get the [admin-sdk](https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup#initialize-sdk) and [Web API Key](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/rest/auth)
5. Save them to SERVICE_ACCOUNT and API_KEY in the `.env`-file

### 2. Use the Firebase emulators

1. Run `npm run emulators` in one terminal window
2. Run `npm run dev` in a second

When the SERVICE_ACCOUNT and CLIENT_CONFIG environment variables have not been set, `npm run dev` will default to using the local emulator.

When you run `npm run emulators`, an initial user is created with credentials `user@example.com:password`. This can be configured in `firebase-fixtures/auth/accounts.json` or via the emulator UI.

## Auth (`app/server/auth.server.ts`)

`signIn` returns a Firebase session-cookie-string, when sign-in is successfull. Then Remix `cookieSessionStorage` is used to set, read and destroy it.

`signUp` creates a user and calls sign-in to receive the session cookie.

`requireAuth` uses `firebase-admin` to verify the session cookie. When this check fails, it throws a `redirect` to the login page. Use this method to protect loaders and actions. The returned `UserRecord` can be handy to request or manipulate data from the Firestore for this user.

## Firestore (`app/server/db.server.ts`)

Requests to the Firestore are made using the `firebase-admin`-SDK. You need to check validity of your requests manually, since `firestore.rules` don't apply to admin requests.

`converter` and `datapoint` are utilities to allow typed Firestore data reads and writes.
