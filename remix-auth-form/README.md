## Example

This is using Remix Auth and the `remix-auth-form` packages.

The `/login` route renders a form with a email and password input. After a submit it runs some validations and store the user email in the session.

The `/private` routes redirects the user to `/login` if it's not logged-in, or shows the user email and a logout form if it's logged-in.
