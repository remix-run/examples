## Example

This example shows how to use routes to show/hide modals.

Using routes has some advantages over `useState` or other state management solutions.

- You can share links to open modals (eg. edit modal of a specific data row)
- No need for state variables

This example uses `@reach/dialog` for displaying the modals.
