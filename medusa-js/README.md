# Welcome to Remix!

- ðŸ“– [Remix docs](https://remix.run/docs)

## Prerequisites

Install Medusa CLI:

```sh
npm install @medusajs/medusa-cli -g
```

Create a new Medusa project(within same directory):

```sh
medusa new <folder-name> # or npx @medusajs/medusa-cli new
```

## Development

Start your Medusa backend:

```sh
cd <folder-name>
medusa develop # or npx medusa develop
```

Run the Remix dev server:

```shellscript
npm run dev
```

## Deployment

First, build your app for production:

```sh
npm run build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
npm start
```

Now you'll need to pick a host to deploy it to.

### DIY

If you're familiar with deploying Node applications, the built-in Remix app server is production-ready.

Make sure to deploy the output of `npm run build`

- `build/server`
- `build/client`

## Styling

This template comes with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) already configured for a simple default starting experience. You can use whatever css framework you prefer. See the [Vite docs on css](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html#css) for more information.
