# GraphQL API

This example demonstrates using the [Fetch API][link-fetch] to query a [GraphQL][link-graphql] endpoint. It also makes use of a [GraphQL Code Generator][link-codegen] which introspects the [GraphQL API][link-sample-api] in order to generate types that can be used in our `useLoaderData` hooks for strong, generated types.

## Setup

- Setup the `GRAPHQL_API` environment variable
  - See the [Remix docs](https://remix.run/docs/guides/envvars) for some suggested patterns
- Run `npm install`
- And start the example with `npm run dev`
- Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Example

This example makes use of [Remix Resource Routes][link-resource-routes] to fetch data from a sample [GraphQL API][link-sample-api] in addition to exposing that data via a JSON API.

**The relevant files:**

- [app/routes/api/characters.tsx](./app/routes/api/characters.tsx) & [app/routes/api/character.tsx](./app/routes/api/character.tsx)
  - These are the [Remix Resource Routes][link-resource-routes] that expose data via a JSON API
  - They fetch from the [GraphQL API][link-sample-api] using the [Fetch API][link-fetch]
- [app/routes/index.tsx](./app/routes/index.tsx)
  - This route fetches a list of characters
  - It's able to re-use the loader used by our API directly ðŸŽ‰
- [app/routes/character/\$id.tsx](./app/routes/character/$id.tsx)
  - This route fetches a single character from the API we've exposed
  - The loader makes use of a fetch and URL params
- [codegen.yml](./codegen.yml)
  - A configuration file for the [GraphQL Code Generator][link-codegen]
  - "Generate anything from GraphQL schema / operations!"
