## Example

This is using Remix Auth and the remix-auth-auth0 packages.

The / route renders a single Sign In with Auth0 button, after the submit it starts the login flow with Auth0.

The /private routes redirects the user to / if it's not logged-in, or shows the user profile from Auth0 if it's logged-in
