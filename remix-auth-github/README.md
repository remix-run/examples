## Example

This is using Remix Auth and the `remix-auth-github` packages.

The `/` route renders a single Sign In with GitHub button, after the submit it starts the login flow with GitHub.

The `/private` routes redirects the user to `/login` if it's not logged-in, or shows the user profile from GitHub if it's logged-in
