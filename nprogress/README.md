## Example

It shows how to load NProgress, link to their styles from the node_modules folder, and use the useTransition hook to know when a client-side transition, both submit or navigation, is happening to start the progress bar.

To visualize it, the `/` route has a link to `/slow-page` whose loader takes one second to load so the progress bar is noticiable for more time
