## Example

The example creates a `cn.server.ts` file to create the Collected notes API client instance.

The route `/` shows the Collected Notes site and list of notes, a search form to use the Collected Notes search API and basic next/prev pagination at the end of the list.

There's then a `/:slug` URL to show the note content.
