# Remix Linear Style Realtime App & Web Components

This example shows you to build a web app experience with Remix, including real time updates with Server Sent Events.

It also includes an example of using Web Components to add interactivity to leaf nodes in a way that keeps them from being specific to any one rendering library (like React).

From your terminal:

```sh
npm i
npm run dev
```
