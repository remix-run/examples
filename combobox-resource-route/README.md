## Example

As the user types into the input field, a fetcher loads suggestions from the server.

The relevant files are:

- app/routes/index.tsx - The UI route with the combobox.
- app/routes/lang-search.tsx - The Resource Route that searches languages.
- app/models/langs.ts - The "model" that holds the languages data and knows how to search it.
