## Example

This example shows how to use Leaflet with Remix.

Relevant files:

- [app/components/client-only.tsx](app/components/client-only.tsx)
- [app/components/map.client.tsx](app/components/map.client.tsx)

Leaflet cannot be rendered on the server side, so we're using the `ClientOnly` component to display a skeleton instead.
It's important to add the `.client.tsx` suffix to the `Map` component file name, otherwise, you will get this error:

```
Error [ERR_REQUIRE_ESM]: require() of ES Module /remix/examples/leaflet/node_modules/react-leaflet/lib/index.js from /remix/examples/leaflet/build/index.js not supported.
```

The leaflet styles can be imported either from `node_modules` or CDN.
If you choose to import the styles from `node_modules`, you'll need to add the leaflet assets in the `/public` folder.
The assets can be found here: [https://unpkg.com/browse/leaflet@1.8.0/dist/images/](https://unpkg.com/browse/leaflet@1.8.0/dist/images/)
