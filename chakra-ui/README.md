In this setup we will setup Chakra UI with Remix.

Please note that when adding Chakra UI to a TypeScript project, a minimum TypeScript version of `4.1.0` is required

## Example

This example shows how to use Chakra UI with Remix.

Check [app/root.tsx](./app/root.tsx) where Chakra UI is imported and provides context to the component tree.

Uncomment the thrown error on `./app/root.tsx` to see how Chackra UI handles your styles graciously on `CatchBoundary`. Then, navigate a **Not Found** route (like `/admin`) to see `ErrorBoundary` in action.
