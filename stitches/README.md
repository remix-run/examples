### Stitches related files

```
- app/
  - styles/
    - client.context.tsx
    - stitches.config.ts
  - entry.client.tsx
  - entry.server.tsx
  - root.tsx
```

1. `client.context.tsx` - Keeps the client context of styles and to reset styles sheets after every interaction into the state.
2. `stitches.config.ts` - Keeps the Stitches configuration that is shared into
   the project.
3. `entry.client.tsx` - Every time that styles update and be re-injected it sets the
   Stitches sheet to a React state.
4. `entry.server.tsx` - Create the markup with the styles injected to serve on the server response.
