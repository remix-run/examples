# Remix Examples

Welcome to `@remix-run/examples`, the **community-driven** repository.

Here you'll find various examples of using Remix to accomplish certain tasks.

Each example is a complete application including a build and even a button to preview a live instance of the app so you can play with it.

Remember to check out the `README` for each example before getting started.

You can also initialize a new project with any of these examples using the `--template` flag of the `create-remix` CLI.

For example:

```
npx create-remix@latest --template examples/<example-dir>
```

Enjoy!
