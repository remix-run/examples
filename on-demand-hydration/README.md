# On-Demand JS Hydration

This examples show how you can, not only enable or disable JS statically using the `handle` export, but also do it on-demand based on the route data returned by the loader.

## Example

The example has four routes, the `/` which has links to the rest and three more:

1. With JS
2. Without JS
3. On-Demand JS

The first one, shows how using `handle = { hydrate: true }`, we can enable the load of JS.

The second one, shows how by not exporting the `handle`, we can disable the load of JS.

The third one, shows how we can make the `hydrate` be a function, read the `loader` data there and use it to decide if we should load JS or not. The example uses a `?js` search param to enable it or not, but you could use actual data.

All examples use the `useShouldHydrate` hook from Remix Utils to know if it should render or not the Scripts component in the root route.
