## Example

This example shows how to use vanilla-extract in Remix. Vanilla-extract is a zero-runtime CSS-in-TypeScript library that converts `.css.ts` files into static CSS at build time, providing first-class support for local-scoping of classes, variables, themes and more.

## Architecture and Tradeoffs

- A separate [tsup](https://github.com/egoist/tsup) process is needed to generate CSS, JavaScript and type definitions, whereas vanilla-extract is typically hooked up to your bundler. Effectively we're treating vanilla-extract more like a traditional CSS preprocessor like [Sass](https://sass-lang.com) or [Less.](https://lesscss.org)
- All styles from `.css.ts` files need to be manually re-exported from `/.styles/index.ts` which is then compiled into `/app/styles` for the Remix app to consume. You can think of it as maintaining a style manifest file. Conceptually this is the same as writing an `index.scss` file in Sass, except that JavaScript code and type definitions are generated in addition to CSS.
- All styles are built into `/app/styles/index.css` which your Remix app needs to include via a `links` function.
- Remix app code always needs to import styles from `~/styles`, even if a `.css.ts` file is in the same directory as the Remix code that imports it. If you don't do this, your vanilla-extract styles won't be compiled properly as they will go directly through the Remix compiler.
- You can keep the file size down using [Sprinkles](https://vanilla-extract.style/documentation/packages/sprinkles) which generates compression-friendly atomic CSS. You can then access these classes at runtime via the type-safe `sprinkles` function.
- To reduce boilerplate in your React code, Sprinkles can be wired up to a `Box` component as demonstrated in this project, allowing you to access atomic styles via props.

- [package.json](./package.json) where tsup is hooked up to the `dev` and `build` scripts using [npm-run-all.](http://npmjs.com/package/npm-run-all)
- [.styles/index.ts](./.styles/index.ts) where everything generated by vanilla-extract is re-exported for the Remix app to consume.
- [.styles/global.css.ts](./.styles/global.css.ts) where global styles are defined.
- [.styles/sprinkles.css.ts](./.styles/sprinkles.css.ts) where utility classes are configured using Sprinkles.
- [app/root.tsx](./app/root.tsx) where the generated CSS file is imported into the Remix app.
- [app/components/Box/Box.ts](./app/components/Box/Box.ts) where the utility classes generated by Sprinkles are hooked up to a primitive `Box` component.
- [app/components/Text/Text.tsx](./app/components/Text/Text.tsx) where you can see an example of component-level styles being imported from `~/styles`.
- [app/components/Text/Text.css.ts](./app/components/Text/Text.css.ts) where you can see an example of component-level styles being defined.
- [.eslintrc](.eslintrc) where everything in the generated `/app/styles` directory is added to ESLint's `ignorePatterns`.
- [.gitignore](.gitignore) where the generated `/app/styles` directory is added to the ignore list.
