# FormData decoding with io-ts

This example shows how to utilize [io-ts](https://gcanti.github.io/io-ts/) to decode [FormData](https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/API/FormData).

## Example

### Motivation

When working directly with `FormData` in a Remix action, it's often inconvenient to narrow down the exact types.

TypeScript cannot statically analyze `FormData` because its values are only known at runtime: it's the user who fills out a form with the values of their choosing. That's why TypeScript will assign the type `FormDataEntryValue | null` as the return type of any call to `FormData#get`:

```typescript
const formData = await request.formData();
const name = formData.get("name"); // type: `FormDataEntryValue | null`
const age = formData.get("age"); // type: `FormDataEntryValue | null`
```

Typically, you want to _do something_ with `name` and `age`, e.g. create a new user in a database with [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/). Since Prisma's database client is type-safe, it will expect `name` to be a `string` and `age` to be a `number`, which is not the case:

```typescript
const user = await prisma.user.create({
  data: {
    name, // type error
    age, // type error
  },
});
```

The resulting type errors could be sidestepped with [type assertions](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html#type-assertions):

```typescript
const name = formData.get("name") as string;
const age = formData.get("age") as number;
```

This could lead to subtle bugs, however. Since the data is provided by the user,
those assertions are not guaranteed to be safe:

> Reminder: Because type assertions are removed at compile-time, there is no
> runtime checking associated with a type assertion. There wonâ€™t be an exception
> or null generated if the type assertion is wrong.

### Solution

io-ts describes itself as a _"runtime type system for IO decoding/encoding"_. It can do what TypeScript by itself is not designed for: validate types at runtime. `app/formData.ts` implements a function `decodeFormData` that takes a `Request` and a [runtime representation of a type](https://gcanti.github.io/io-ts/modules/index.ts.html#type) and returns a correctly typed record with the form's data. In case the data is malformed, it will throw a [422 Uprocessable Entity](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/422).

The route `app/routes/index.tsx` implements an action that calls `decodeFormData`. It also implements a [CatchBoundary](https://remix.run/route/catch-boundary), which will render iff you provide anything other than a number to the `<input name="age" />`.
