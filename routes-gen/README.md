This example shows to install and run the `routes-gen` script with the Remix driver. There are also a couple of routes for showcasing the usage of the generated type-safe `route` helper.

## Example

In this example, we've installed `routes-gen` and `@routes-gen/remix`.

For convenience, we've added the `routes-gen` script to our `package.json`, so we wouldn't have to specify the Remix driver each time we generated the routes typings.

This example has 3 routes:

- `/`
- `/products`
- `/products/:productId`

You can see the typings for these routes in `app/routes.d.ts`, which will be generated automatically by running `npm run routes-gen`. Do not edit this file manually, since it will be overwritten next time you run the script.

If you'll take a look at the source of the routes, you'll see how the `route` helper is used for a type-safe route usage.

Go ahead and create a couple of new routes, both with and without dynamic parameters. After that, run `npm run routes-gen` and you'll see that the `route` method now has typings for all the new routes.
