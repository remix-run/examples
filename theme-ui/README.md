# Example app with [theme-ui](https://theme-ui.com/)

This example features how to use [theme-ui](https://theme-ui.com/) with Remix.

## How this implementation works

Since [theme-ui](https://theme-ui.com/) is derived from [emotion](https://emotion.sh/), this example shows how we can leverage Emotion's server-side-caching to enable [theme-ui](https://theme-ui.com/) server side rendering.

_This implementation was based off [Saas-UI Remix guide](https://www.saas-ui.dev/docs/core/installation/remix-guide)._

```

1. `context.tsx` - Creates the server and client context.
2. `createEmotionCache.ts` - Create an instance of [Emotion cache](https://emotion.sh/docs/@emotion/cache).
3. `entry.client.tsx` - Consumes the emotion cache generated by the server and creates a provider that is then passed on the the app.
4. `entry.server.tsx` - Create the markup with the styles injected to serve on the server response.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/routes/_index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Commands

- `dev`: runs your application on `localhost:3000`
- `build`: creates the production build version
- `start`: starts a simple server with the build production code
